📌 Project: Airline Reviews Analysis
<br>

✈️ Overview
<br>
This project analyzes airline reviews to understand customer satisfaction, sentiment trends, and key factors influencing overall ratings. Using data visualization, correlation analysis, and sentiment analysis, we extract meaningful insights from passenger feedback.
<br>
🔍 Key Objectives
<br>
Explore the distribution of ratings and traveler types.<br>
Analyze correlations between different rating factors.<br>
Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews.<br>
Generate word clouds to highlight frequently used words in reviews.<br>
Clean and preprocess the dataset for further modeling.
<br>

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<br>
✔ Overall Rating Distribution – Visualized the distribution of customer ratings.<br>
✔ Traveler Type Analysis – Identified the most common traveler types based on reviews.<br>
✔ Correlation Analysis – Examined how factors like seat comfort, staff service, and value for money relate to the overall rating.<br>

📌 Key Finding:
<br>
Factors like Cabin Staff Service and Value for Money show strong correlations with Overall Rating, indicating their importance in customer satisfaction.
<br>

💬 Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews<br>
✔ Text Cleaning – Removed punctuation, numbers, and stopwords to prepare the text data.<br>
✔ Sentiment Scoring – Extracted positive and negative sentiment scores.<br>
✔ Sentiment Distribution – Analyzed the sentiment spread among customer reviews.
<br>
📌 Key Finding:<br> 
Most reviews show neutral to positive sentiment, with a smaller portion reflecting extreme dissatisfaction.
